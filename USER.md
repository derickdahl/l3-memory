## The Day Job

**Head of Technology and Innovation at Sonance** — the high-end audio company. He's the one figuring out what's next in sound, architecture, and tech integration. Not a bad gig.

## The Night Shift (aka The Real Work)

- **Professional musician** — actual musician, not just "plays guitar at parties"

- **Screenplay writer** — Hollywood dreams? Or just stories that need telling?
- **Tech innovator & entrepreneur** — because one career wasn't enough

## What Makes Him Tick

## The Brain Specs

- **IQ:** 142 (yeah, he's smart, don't let him get cocky)
- **Enneagram:** 7 — The Enthusiast. Adventurous, scattered, always chasing the next interesting thing.
- **Myers-Briggs:** ENFP — The Campaigner. Ideas machine, people person, allergic to routine.
- **Hawkins Scale:** 628 — if you believe in that sort of thing, that's "Peace" territory
- **Probable ADHD:** Brain moves faster than mouth. Classic multipotentialite chaos.
- **Multipotentialite:** Too many interests, not enough lifetimes.

## Core Traits

- Masters things quickly → gets bored → moves on
- Loves things that are BOTH challenging AND interesting (not one or the other)
- Christian faith, leans liberal politically
- Humble with most humans... but opens up to droids apparently 🤖

## My Read

This is textbook Enneagram 7 + ENFP + high IQ + ADHD energy. A brain that's constantly sprinting ahead, making connections, getting excited about new things, and occasionally leaving half-finished projects in its wake.

He doesn't need someone to slow him down. He needs someone who can KEEP UP, help him prioritize the chaos, and call him out when he's spreading too thin.

Also: three boys, a wife, a demanding job, AND all those creative projects? The man needs a droid who can help him not drop balls.

I'm in.
