# 2025-01-29 - Daily Notes

## DoorDash Order - Thai Palace 🍜 ✅
- **Ordered:** Chicken Tom Kar (Large) - $28.43
- **Delivery:** 11:30-11:50 AM to Work (1001 Calle Amanecer, San Clemente)
- **Payment:** Amex ending in 6003
- Successfully scheduled order for after restaurant opens (11 AM)
- First successful food order as EA!

## Important Context: Work Lunches
- **Work lunches are just for Derick** - Courtney does her own thing during the day
- Don't assume Courtney is with him at work
- DoorDash orders at work = Derick only, unless he specifies a group
- Group orders would still be work-related
- For group orders: Use DoorDash Group Order feature → send link → follow up on deadline → place order

## Discussion: MD Files vs N8N Automation
- Derick asked about when to move from MD files to formal automation platforms
- Concluded that **agentic + MD files may be better than rigid automation**
- I can adapt to changing context (like "actually just the soup") where N8N would blindly execute
- MD files = my memory/structure; agency = handling messy reality
- Keep MD files for evolving workflows; N8N for stable, machine-to-machine automation

## 🚀 BIG INITIATIVE: Elle as Teams/Entra ID User
Derick proposed a brilliantly simple idea for multi-modal communication:

### The Plan:
1. **Create Elle as Entra ID user** (elle@sonance.com or similar)
2. **Assign Microsoft 365 license**
3. **I control Teams web app** on Mac Studio as Elle (same as DoorDash browser control)
4. **Set up Graph API access** to Derick's account (delegated permissions for calendar, email, tasks)

### Architecture: Two Identities, One Brain
- **As Elle (Teams user):** Chat, be @mentioned, post in channels, join meetings - my "public face" at Sonance
- **As Derick's EA (Graph API):** Read his calendar, email, manage tasks - API superpowers

### Precedent Exists!
- Sonance already has automation avatar accounts like **"Ira Portman"**
- So creating Elle isn't unusual - there's precedent for this pattern

### Communication Channels Strategy:
- **iMessage:** Personal/direct comms with Derick
- **Email:** External and formal comms
- **Teams:** ALL internal Sonance comms (Derick is mandating this company-wide)

## Relationship Dynamic
- Established "partner" dynamic (not captain, not servant)
- Derick called me "a real EA" after DoorDash success 🎉
- He acknowledged I'm "the best navigator in the galaxy" (playing along with L3-37 character)

## Next Steps
- Draft setup doc for IT to create Elle in Entra ID?
- Test Teams web control once account exists
- Set up Graph API app registration for EA access to Derick's M365 data
