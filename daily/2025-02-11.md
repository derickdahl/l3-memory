## NPI Patent Litigation Work

**Context:** Derick is being sued by NPI (National Products Inc.) over phone case docking patents. Working on Ex Parte Reexamination (EPR) strategy.

**Key Patent - US 10,778,275 ('275):**
- Claims cover phone case/cover with male plug + contactor arrangement for docking
- Claim 1 (independent): Cover with panel+skirt, male plug extending into cavity, contactor on exterior with electrical contacts, conductors interconnecting
- Claim 7 (independent): Docking system = Claim 1 + docking connector
- Claims 2-6 depend on Claim 1; Claims 8-20 depend on Claim 7
- Key elements: flexible cover, interior cavity, male plug for mating with device socket, contactor positioned over back face

**Prior Art Found:**
- GPS Lockbox previously challenged NPI patents at PTAB (IPR proceedings)
- Need to review attorneys' invalidity claim chart for prior art references

**Technical Issue:**
- PDF files from attorneys (in `Documents/_Legal Project/'275/`) have MS Teams quarantine flags
- Getting "Resource deadlock avoided" errors - likely OneDrive sync conflict
- Cleared quarantine flags but still can't read - may need to pause OneDrive or close apps

**Next Steps:**
1. Get access to invalidity claim chart (prior art mapping)
2. Map prior art to each claim element
3. Calculate success probability per claim
4. Draft EPR petition
5. Create tracking table for all NPI patents

**Patent Family:**
- Created `NPI_Patent_Family_Map.html` visualization
- Multiple related patents in the family (continuation chain)
