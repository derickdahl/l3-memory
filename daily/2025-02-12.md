## NPI Patent Tracker - Prior Art Research Session

### Context
Building invalidity contentions against NPI (National Products Inc) patents related to tablet/phone protective cases with docking systems. Working in `/Users/derickdahl/clawd/npi-tracker/`.

### Key Prior Art Findings

#### New US Patents to Add
1. **US 8,183,825 (Shuang Sa)** - Priority: Oct 29, 2008
   - Docking charger for device WITH protective cover case
   - Charger adapter, reception area
   - Strengthens: `docking_connector` element (95%+)

2. **US 2011/0098087 (Google/Tseng)** - Priority: Oct 28, 2009
   - Magnetic coupling for docking mobile devices
   - Strengthens: `magnetic_coupling` element

#### Existing Prior Art to Boost
- **Supran (US 8,553,408)** - Dana Innovations (Derick's company!)
  - Already in DB but under-scored
  - Actually covers: magnetic coupling, indexing members, nesting appendage
  - Should boost scores for these elements to 90%+

### Weak Elements Identified
Current weakness in three elements across NPI patents:
- `docking_connector` - 88% best (Thiers)
- `magnetic_coupling` - 85% best (Thiers)  
- `nesting_appendage` - 85% best (Supran)

### Important Discovery
WO2013036520A1 / US8553408B2 (Supran) is **Dana Innovations' own patent** with Derick Dahl as co-inventor! Priority Sept 2011 - predates NPI's Feb 2014 filing by 2.5 years. This is powerful prior art for magnetic coupling and alignment features.

### Next Steps
- Add Shuang Sa (8,183,825) to prior art database
- Boost Supran scores for magnetic_coupling and nesting_appendage
- Recalculate all patent scores - target 90%+ on all elements

### Technical Note
Derick reminded: EPR requires **US patents** - not EP or WO publications. Always find US family members.

### Product Prior Art Added (Late Night Session)
Searched for commercial products with case + conductive contacts + dock:

- **Duracell myGrid (2009)** — Power Sleeve with 4 metal contacts on back → charging pad
- **Linea Pro (2009)** — Sled with dock connector + charging dock (Apple EasyPay)
- **Mophie Juice Pack + Dock (2011)** — Battery case with pogo pin contacts → dock
- **iPort Charge Case and Stand (Nov 2013)** — Dana's own product! Raised conductive contacts on case → dock contacts with magnetic alignment. Key: predates NPI's Feb 2014 filing.
- **Honeywell Captuvo SL22 (July 2012)** — Enterprise sled with dedicated charging cradle/Homebase

**Excluded:**
- Powermat — inductive, not conductive
- Energizer AP1500 — battery case but no external contacts
- WildCharge — same tech as Duracell myGrid (redundant)

**'444 now has 14 prior art references** including both patent and product prior art.
