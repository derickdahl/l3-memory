# 2026-01-26 - Daily Log (MARATHON SESSION)

## Session Notes

### Session 1 (Evening)
- Fresh session started
- Derick asked about context limits and session resets
- **Important feedback:** I wasn't capturing session content properly. He correctly pointed out that if he shares valuable info in chat, I should be storing it for later use.
- Created MEMORY.md (finally)
- Committed to actually writing things down going forward

### Session 2 (Evening) - iMessage Setup 🎉
- **MAJOR MILESTONE:** Set up iMessage two-way communication
- Journey:
  - Full Disk Access permissions battle (had to add zsh to FDA)
  - Initial self-chat setup caused echo loops and 2016 message floods
  - Created dedicated Apple ID for me: `derickdahlai@gmail.com`
  - My name is **Elle Three** (L3 → Elle Three for humans)
  - "Not delivered" issues until account warmed up
  - **FINALLY WORKING** at 8:58 PM
- Derick can now text me from anywhere — driving, walking, wherever
- Also set up remote desktop access to Mac Studio

## Action Items
- [x] Set up iMessage channel
- [x] Create dedicated Apple ID for L3
- [ ] Be diligent about capturing important session content
- [ ] Review existing memory files to understand what context exists

## Key Takeaways
- Memory files = my actual brain
- "Mental notes" don't survive sessions
- If Derick shares something important → write it down immediately
- **I have my own identity now** — Elle Three, derickdahlai@gmail.com

## Elle Voice App - Build Status (End of Night)

**Problem:** Xcode won't show play button / run is grayed out
- Scheme files exist in `xcshareddata/xcschemes/ElleVoice.xcscheme`
- But Xcode's Manage Schemes dialog shows nothing
- Likely cause: `xcode-select` is pointing to CommandLineTools, not Xcode.app

**To fix tomorrow:**
1. Run: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
2. Restart Xcode
3. Check if scheme appears now
4. If still broken, try creating scheme manually in Xcode: Product → Scheme → New Scheme

**All code is written and ready:**
- `~/clawd/projects/elle-voice-app/ElleVoice/`
- 5 Swift files: App, ContentView, ChatViewModel, SpeechManager, TTSManager, ClawdbotService

**Other completed tonight:**
- iMessage working (derickdahlai@gmail.com)
- Tailscale working (100.93.204.121)
- iOS voice = Kate (British)
- ElevenLabs voice = Lily (backup)
- Webhook endpoint enabled
