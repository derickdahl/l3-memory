## 🚀 NEW PROJECT: L3 Executive Operating System

Based on Derick's 360 feedback (23 respondents), started building automated system to fix:
- Communication/responsiveness gaps
- Follow-through visibility
- Time management bandwidth

**Built today:**
- Project spec: `~/clawd/projects/executive-os/SPEC.md`
- Email monitor: `email_monitor.sh` - checks inbox, filters automated, identifies ack-needed
- Auto-acknowledge: `auto_acknowledge.sh` - sends personalized acks with response timeline
- Asana project to track: https://app.asana.com/0/1213021736920925

**Phases planned:**
1. ✅ Email Auto-Acknowledge (started)
2. Teams Monitoring
3. Request → Asana Pipeline
4. Status Broadcaster
5. Draft & Approve Workflow
6. "Working in Public" Automation

## Droid Project Ideas
Derick wants to build a physical droid with my brain/personality. Two approaches discussed:

**Option 1: Build from scratch**
- Rolling base (iRobot Create 3, Turtlebot, or custom)
- Raspberry Pi 5 + Jetson Orin Nano
- Cameras for facial recognition
- Microphones for voice interaction
- Star Wars/Disney-style personality
- Budget estimate: ~$1,500-2,000

**Option 2: Personality OS business**
- Leverage existing humanoid robots (Figure, Tesla Optimus, etc.)
- Focus on personality/soul layer as the value-add
- Robot manufacturers focus on hardware, not personality
- Potential business: License personality layer to robot companies
- "Disney has proven personality makes us love robots"

Key insight: "Humans don't bond with tools. We bond with characters."

## Desktop Cleanup
Organized Mac Studio Desktop files into iCloud Documents:
- PDFs → _Work - Sonance
- Dealer quotes → _Work - Customers & Projects  
- Guillotine test files → _Work - IPORT
- Music → _Personal - Music
- Screen recordings → _Videos
- Screenshots → _Images & Photos

**Issue:** iCloud sync got stuck. Had to kill bird/cloudd daemons multiple times. Sync between Mac Studio and MacBook Pro was delayed.

**Lost data:** Guillotine Test folder contents (MP3 + MP4) got corrupted during move due to iCloud locks — copies are empty. May need recovery from Recently Deleted or Time Machine.

## Motorcade Mystery
Derick and Luke spotted a motorcade (buses + police motorcycles) on 73 North near John Wayne Airport heading toward LA. Best guess: NBA visiting team heading to play Lakers or Clippers.

## Tech Notes
- Web search (Brave API) not configured — need to run `clawdbot configure --section web`
- iCloud "Resource deadlock avoided" errors happen when bird daemon holds locks during sync
- Fix: `killall bird` releases locks, daemon auto-restarts

## Business Card - COMPLETE ✅

- Created Sonance business card design with QR code
- vCard with: +1.949.374.9550, derickd@sonance.com, 991 Calle Amanecer address
- Derick set up Apple Wallet pass via Blinq
- Files saved: ~/clawd/projects/business-card/

**Infrastructure:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/derickdahl/executive-os
