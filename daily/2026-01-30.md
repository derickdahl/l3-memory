## Derick's Favorite Lunches 🍜🍣

Confirmed two go-to lunch orders:

1. **Tom Ka Soup** from **Thai Palace** (0.4 mi away)
2. **Poke Bowl** from **Wowpoki** (0.4 mi away)
   - His usual Large Bowl build:
     - Base: Salad (or Half White Rice & Half Salad)
     - Fish: Tuna, Spicy Tuna ×2, Albacore (or Salmon), Yellow Tail
     - Spice: Medium
     - Sides: Crab Meat + Extra Crab Meat (+$1.50)
     - Toppings: Masago, Seaweed, Green Onion, Ginger
   - Today he swapped Albacore → Salmon

## DoorDash Order

Placed Wowpoki Large Bowl order ~11:50 AM
- ETA: 12:01-12:11 PM
- Total: $29.12
- Delivered to Work (1001 Calle Amanecer)

## Quick-Order Authorization

Derick authorized one-shot food commands:
- "Order Poke" or "Order Tom Ka Soup" = FULL GO, no confirmation needed
- But sanity-check the time: ~11am-1pm is lunch, outside that window = confirm first (likely misfire)
