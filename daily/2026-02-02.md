## Greece Travel Guide (for Pat & Cindy)
- Friends Pat & Cindy traveling: Barcelona → Greece
- Main guide: https://greece-guide.vercel.app
- Athens Top 10: https://greece-guide.vercel.app/athens.html
- GitHub: derickdahl/greece-guide

## Technical Notes
- Vercel deployments need `projectSettings` for new projects
- Wikipedia image URLs often return 404 - use TripAdvisor CDN instead
- Don't use `vercel.json` with catch-all routes for static multi-page sites
- iMessage links: Don't wrap URLs in ** asterisks - breaks clickability
