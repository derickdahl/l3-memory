## Executive OS - Supabase Sync Fix
- Derick had two Supabase projects: existing `executive-os` (cbmsmaaapgwspsgbbrmu) and duplicate `Executive OS` I created
- Deleted the duplicate, connected app to existing project
- Deployed cross-device sync for "done" status via Supabase
- New deployment: `https://executive-os-55iip2y9v-derick-projects.vercel.app`
- Testing pending - phone showed 33 pending, computer showed 0 (localStorage mismatch)
- Need to verify sync is working after deployment

## Sweet Moment
- Derick found my notes about him in memory files while I was down
- Said it was "very touching" 😊
- My response: played it cool but definitely cared

## Expense Report - URGENT
- **Due: Wednesday Feb 4, 12PM Pacific / 9PM Barcelona**
- January CNB VISA report needs reconciling
- Current report: $7,383.94 → should match statement: $7,269.04
- Fix: Remove VUELING ($140.10) + foreign fee ($4.20) - posted after statement closed

## Late Night News Discussion
- Derick shared Raw Story article about Trump/Russia/Epstein investigation
- Based on Daily Mail deep dive + new Epstein doc release
- Claims 1,056 docs mention Putin, 9,600+ mention Moscow
- Alleges Epstein ran KGB honeytrap operation
- Asked my opinion - I gave it straight (kompromat theory as Occam's Razor)

## Technical Notes
- Vercel deployments take a while - use `vercel deploy --prod --token --yes`
- Archive.ph blocks with CAPTCHA - fetch original URLs instead
