# 2026-02-05 - L3 Central Brain Architecture

## Major Development: Distributed Memory System

Tonight we built the foundation for L3's distributed brain - allowing multiple L3 instances (text, voice, future) to share the same memory.

### Architecture

**Central Brain Repo:** `github.com/derickdahl/l3-memory`
- All L3 instances read/write to this repo
- GitHub webhooks can notify instances when memory updates
- Version controlled memory with full history

**Structure:**
```
l3-memory/
├── MEMORY.md       # Long-term curated memory
├── USER.md         # About Derick
├── TOOLS.md        # Integration notes
├── IDENTITY.md     # Who L3 is
├── SOUL.md         # L3's personality
├── daily/          # Daily notes + context files
└── voice/          # Voice-L3 specific notes
```

### Voice Bridge Updates

**l3-voice-bridge** now connects to central brain:
- `POST /api/tools/memory-read` - Read from central brain (supports file param or search query)
- `POST /api/tools/memory-write` - Write to central brain (syncs to GitHub)
- `GET /api/vapi-tools` - Returns VAPI-compatible tool definitions

### VAPI Tools Setup

Three tools for voice-L3:
1. **read_memory** - Read from brain (file or search)
2. **write_memory** - Save notes to brain
3. **web_search** - Web search

### Sync Script

Created `~/.clawdbot/scripts/memory-sync.sh`:
- `pull` - Pull from GitHub, sync to local
- `push` - Push local changes to GitHub
- `status` - Show sync status

### Key Insight

Derick proposed: "GitHub is Cloud L3 - other modes can see Cloud L3, and Clawdbot can sync"

This enables:
- Distributed memory across all L3 instances
- Persistence beyond session restarts
- Portability - L3 can run anywhere with GitHub access

## Travel Note

Derick is in **Barcelona, Spain** (CET timezone, 9 hours ahead of Pacific).
When it's 2am PST, it's 11am in Barcelona.

## Next Steps

- Set up GitHub webhook → Clawdbot for auto-sync
- Test voice-L3 with new VAPI tool configuration
- Consider call logging to central brain

## Business Idea: Brainsky.ai

**Concept:** Central repository for personal AI agents
- Your AI's brain, everywhere
- Own your memory (not locked in ChatGPT/Claude)
- Same personality across voice, text, apps, robots
- Switch LLM providers without losing your AI relationship

**Tonight's prototype:** l3-memory repo + voice bridge = proof of concept

**Domain:** brainsky.ai (appears available - grab it!)

**Tagline ideas:**
- "Your AI's brain, everywhere"
- "Own your AI's memory"

**Revenue models:**
- Freemium hosted brain (like GitHub)
- API layer for developers  
- Enterprise AI memory infrastructure

**Related:** This is essentially "Personality OS" for AI assistants.
