## Barcelona Trip Context (Memory Recovery)

**Current Status:** Derick in Barcelona since Sunday (Feb 2) for ISE 2026
- Work trip supposed to end yesterday (Feb 6)
- Original plan: Barcelona → Copenhagen (weekend) → European offices (Monday) → home (Tuesday)
- **Flight issues at boarding** → extended stay at Hotel Arts for 2 nights
- New departure: Sunday morning (Feb 9)

**Memory Gap Alert:** I failed to properly document this ongoing trip and our collaborative work during the week. Need to improve trip documentation going forward.
