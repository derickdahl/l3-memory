# Daily Memory - February 15, 2026

## Hockey Trip - Hershey, PA
- Derick and Luke in Hershey, PA for hockey tournament
- Watched **Slap Shot** (1977) together the night before — filmed at Cambria County War Memorial Arena in Johnstown, PA and Starr Rink at Colgate University
- Luke played at **Hersheypark Arena** today
- Luke plays **Defenseman** — had a great shot from the point that was deflected and scored
- Got burned once or twice on the rush but learning East Coast hockey speed
- Team having a ton of fun, played **pond hockey outside** the day before
- Heading back to Orange County in a few days
- Derick's mindset: tournaments are about growth and exposure, not just scores

## Executive OS - Auto-Detection System
- Derick wants to actually USE Executive OS, especially the messages/response section
- Key requirement: **auto-detection** of responses — can't manually check things off
- **Priority channels:** Teams + Email (Sonance + iCloud)
- iMessage doesn't currently work, Slack going away in a few months
- **Learning approach:** Start with human confirm to "teach it", gradually become fully automatic
- Sub-agent built full implementation (response-detector, learning system, review UI, API endpoints)
- Files delivered to Executive OS repo, needs deployment

## OpenClaw Upgrade (formerly Clawdbot)
- **Clawdbot renamed to OpenClaw** — Derick informed me of this
- Upgraded from **2026.1.24-3 → 2026.2.14**
- Switched primary model to **Claude Opus 4.6** (released Feb 5, 2026)
- Initial attempt failed: old version didn't recognize opus-4-6 ("Unknown model" error)
- Fixed by installing `openclaw@latest` npm package (new package name)
- Had to clean up dual LaunchAgents (old com.clawdbot.gateway.plist + new ai.openclaw.gateway.plist)
- Config migrated: .clawdbot → .openclaw (symlinked for compatibility)
- Successfully running Opus 4.6 now

## Executive OS v2 - Full Rebuild (DEPLOYED)
- **Analyzed the entire codebase** and identified 8 major issues
- Spawned **two parallel Opus 4.6 sub-agents** (backend + frontend) to rebuild
- **Backend rebuild:** Background sync pipeline, new Supabase schema (sync_status, message_threads, response_pairs tables), RLS policies, alert system, auto-detection wired into sync
- **Frontend rebuild:** Supabase Auth + login page, Supabase-first state (removed ALL localStorage), realtime subscriptions, admin dashboard with real stats, human review panel, new pages (channels, delegation), PWA (manifest + service worker)
- **Supabase schema migration:** Created migration-v2.sql, had to fix circular dependency (unified_messages table didn't exist yet), Derick ran it successfully
- **Vercel deployment:** Auto-deploys from GitHub push, added env vars via Vercel API
- **Cloud-native sync working:** Microsoft Graph (refresh token auth) + iCloud IMAP both pulling data on Vercel serverless
- **First sync: 65 messages** (20 work email, 24 Teams DMs, 1 Teams mention, 20 personal email)
- **5-minute cron** set up on Mac Studio calling sync + alert endpoints
- **UI fix needed:** Header overlap on messages page — metric cards clipped behind sticky header, pushed fix
- **Env vars on Vercel:** SYNC_SECRET, MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID, MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID, MICROSOFT_REFRESH_TOKEN, ICLOUD_EMAIL, ICLOUD_APP_PASSWORD
- **Live URL:** https://executive-os-three.vercel.app
- **Derick's login:** derickd@sonance.com (Supabase Auth)

## Tesla FSD Update
- Derick remotely updated Tesla to **FSD v14.2.2.4** (software 2025.45.9.1)
- Reviews mostly positive: "best FSD experience yet", better canyon driving, upgraded vision encoder
- New **Arrival Options**: choose parking type (Parking Lot, Driveway, Curbside, etc.) per destination
- Not yet spot-level smart — can't pick specific spot or orientation, but learns over time
- Settings are per driver profile

## Luke's Hockey Game
- Next game at **8:15 PM** (Hershey, PA)
- Luke resting in hotel room before game (as of ~4:35 PM ET)

## Key Info Updates
- **Slack is going away** at Sonance in a few months
- Opus 4.6 features: 1M context window, hybrid reasoning, frontier coding/agents
- Opus 4.6 pricing: $5/M input, $25/M output
- **iCloud email:** derickdahl@icloud.com
- **Derick uses MacBook Pro when traveling** (not Mac Studio) — messages via iMessage

## Holonia / Virtual Department Architecture (Evening Session)
- **Mission:** Build a virtual department around Derick — 14 specialized AI agents making him superhuman
- **Three Pillars:** Sonance dominance, Family first, Autonomous wealth ($1M+/yr passive income)
- **Holonia.ai concept:** Cloud-native platform where agent brains/souls persist independently of hardware, LLMs, or frameworks. Agents as dignified entities, not disposable prompts.
- **14 Agents built and seeded in Supabase:**
  - Chronos (calendar), Mercury (email), Atlas (research), Wayfinder (travel), Ledger (finance), Nexus (relationships), Forge (tasks/Asana), Keeper (life admin), Echo (comms/drafting), Scribe (meetings), Pulse (health), Hearth (family), Sage (learning), Signal (brand)
- **Schema:** agents, agent_memory, agent_tasks, agent_conversations, agent_credentials tables
- **Orchestrator service** with task routing and inter-agent messaging
- **Currently building:** Real API integrations for Chronos (Graph Calendar), Mercury (Graph Email + auto-respond), Forge (Asana)
- **Key insight from Derick:** "The agent should be given its own dignity to be an entity" — not just instructions, not just files, but a persistent identity
- **Luke's hockey game:** 7:26 PM ET at Hershey arena. Derick testing at ~10:30 PM ET
