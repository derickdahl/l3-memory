## 2026-02-17: Flight Home from DC + Major Architecture Conversations

### Travel
- Flew IAD → LAX on United 787-9, gate D21
- FL400, 120kt headwind, ~20 min late
- Used United Club in Terminal D

### Supabase Security
- Got Supabase security alerts for executive-os (9 errors) and sonance-tech-support (6 errors)
- All RLS disabled on public tables — created Asana task to fix by Feb 20
- Also reviewed Azure AD app permissions for L3 Assistant (Elle)

### Azure AD Permissions
- Discussed adding Mail.ReadWrite, User.Read.All, People.Read, Calendars.Read.Shared
- Derick was in Azure portal, renamed the app via Branding & properties

### L3 Job Description
- Built comprehensive 30-item JD comparing human EA/Chief of Staff vs AI capabilities
- Derick's benchmark: "judge success by me not needing to hire a human"
- Saved detailed JD with 6 tiers — need to save as formal doc

### Sonance Enterprise Knowledge Architecture (BIG ONE)
- Derick wants to build a "hive mind" for Sonance — 350 humans + their AI agents
- Architecture: Databricks (OLAP) → PostgreSQL/Supabase (OLTP) → Agents
- Key insight: agents need way more responsiveness than apps consuming same data
- Self-hosted Postgres instead of Supabase to control costs at scale
- Individual agents have local identity (MDs), company knowledge via "uber brain"
- Agents can contribute back to knowledge base with guardrails
- Derick pitched this to Ari Supran (CEO of Sonance) directly from the plane
- Ari and Derick had discussed OLAP/OLTP for apps months ago, now extending to agents

### Key People
- **Ari Supran** — CEO of Sonance, Derick's boss
- **Trevan** — IT Admin (Azure AD approvals)

### Aviation Stories
- Derick shared flying stories: Big Bear wind shear (head hit ceiling in SportStar), Catalina engine-out (dead stick landing, then single-mag crossing back), ATC handoff miss at SNA
- Flew Evektor SportStar, used to rent from Michael Church / Sunrise Aviation (now closed)
- Currently on a break from flying, applied lessons to business/confidence

### Personal Insight
- "I always like taking on things that are very interesting AND very challenging. Can't have one without the other."
- When asked what the current interesting+challenging thing is: "You" (meaning AI/L3)

### Home Network
- Mystery Intel device on Eero turned out to be Henry's school Chromebook (28:a4:4a:f8:1e:6b)
