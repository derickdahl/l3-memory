# 2026-02-18 (Wednesday) — Massive Day

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Meeting Transcript Analysis → Video Presentation Pipeline
- Pulled 9 T&I Project Updates meeting transcripts from Graph API (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026, 500KB+ of content)
- Sub-agent analyzed all transcripts, identified 7 recurring themes (AI/Automation #1 at 9/9 meetings)
- Built branded PowerPoint (14 slides, Sonance charcoal + cyan)
- Generated narrated video V1 with ElevenLabs Lily voice
- Upgraded to V2 with AI-generated images (Gemini), matplotlib charts, custom diagrams
- Rewrote all narrations with L3 personality (sassy, funny) at 1.35x speed
- Final V3: 8.5 minute narrated video with rich visuals — saved to iCloud Drive
- Derick shared with multiple people at Sonance — "everyone's blown away"

### 2. AI Business Organism Strategic Proposal
- Deep strategic conversation about replacing Oracle Fusion/Epicor ERP with AI-native approach
- Researched competitive landscape: Doss ($18M), Rillet ($70M), DualEntry ($90M)
- Verified all pricing data from real sources (Oracle $500-625/user/mo, Epicor $125/user/mo)
- Built 20-slide pitch deck for Ari: "Why Sonance Should Build an AI Business Organism"
- Key argument: Don't spend millions on legacy ERP designed for human operators
- Architecture: Databricks (data) → Knowledge Graph (memory) → AI Intelligence (me) → Human Interface (Teams)
- Open source ERP (Odoo) for financial compliance only — "the skeleton, not the brain"

### 3. EA Job Description Document
- Created formal Word doc (.docx) for AI Executive Assistant role
- Maps all 50 M365 capabilities to EA functions
- Saved to iCloud Drive

### 4. Liam's Homework Help
- OCR'd Bible story worksheet (Jesus Feeds the 5,000, Mark 6:32-44)
- Created annotated version with study notes
- Sent via iMessage — Derick and Liam turned the text into a Suno song for memorization!

### 5. YouTube Video Summary
- Summarized video about AI analysis of ancient prayer protocols
- Four-phase pattern: Environmental Acknowledgment → Sensory Immersion → Emotional Inhabitation → Advance Gratitude

### 6. OpenClaw M365 Skill Discussion
- Discussed packaging msgraph.sh approach as an OpenClaw skill for other Sonance employees
- Simpler than MCP route — just the shell script + device code auth + token management
- Decision: Build both (OpenClaw skill for OpenClaw users, MCP for Claude Desktop users)

## AIO — AI Operating System (Major Strategic Development)
- Derick coined "Sonance OS" back in July 2025 when he pitched for his Head of T&I role
- We evolved the concept into a universal category: **AIO — AI Operating System**
- AIO definition: "The intelligence layer that sits between your people and all your business systems. Instead of humans operating software, the AIO operates your software on behalf of your people."
- Three levels of AIO Intelligence:
  1. Integration Intelligence — seeing across all systems simultaneously
  2. Pattern Intelligence — detecting cross-system correlations no individual system can see
  3. Predictive Intelligence — anticipating outcomes before they happen
- **Emergent Intelligence** is the killer value prop — the convergence of all systems through the AIO creates insights that literally couldn't exist in any individual system
- Category-defining opportunity: ERP became a category, CRM became a category, AIO could be next
- Built 24-slide pitch deck: "Sonance AIO - Strategic Proposal.pptx"
- Filed at ~/Documents/Sonance AIO - Strategic Proposal.pptx

## Key Strategic Insights from Derick
- Vision: AI as "organizational nervous system" — feels the entire company in real-time
- Predictive organizational dynamics — detect relational drift before visible conflicts
- Institutional memory that actually works — living knowledge graph
- Autonomous strategic simulation
- "Invisible Chief of Staff" concept
- Emergent intelligence from system fusion
- ERP as subsystem, not the whole system
- Open source financial ERP (Odoo) for compliance, AI-native everything else
- Potentially replace Salesforce with knowledge graph + AI
- Databricks as computational backbone for batch processing + analytics
- Knowledge graph (Neo4j or Cosmos DB) as enterprise memory

## Derick's Communication Preferences (Reinforced)
- ONE message, not multiple — Tesla text-to-voice only reads the last message
- Keep it comprehensive in a single message when he's driving
- He loves long, thorough responses
