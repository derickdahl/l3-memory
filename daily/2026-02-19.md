# 2026-02-19 (Thursday) — Pipeline Evolution Day

## Video Pipeline Work

### AIO Narrated Video — COMPLETED
- Two sub-agents completed the AIO pitch deck → narrated video
- Final output: `~/Documents/Sonance AIO - Strategic Proposal - Video.mp4` (~9MB, 24 slides)
- ElevenLabs Lily voice @ 1.35x, Sonance branding (charcoal/cyan/white)
- Pipeline documented at `~/clawd/presentation-pipeline/PIPELINE.md` + `run-pipeline.sh`

### Teams Training Script Deck — COMPLETED
- 55-slide PowerPoint covering 17 training video topics for Slack → Teams migration
- Output: `~/Documents/Teams Training Video Scripts.pptx`
- Full speaker notes with narration scripts for screen recording
- Extracted topics from GFDW Transition.key (Keynote file at `~/Documents/_Work - Dana Innovations/GFDW Transition.key`)

## GFDW Keynote Extraction
- Keynote files use protobuf/IWA binary format — can't use python-pptx
- AppleScript export via Keynote app timed out (may need user interaction/permissions)
- Used `strings` command to extract readable text — worked but noisy
- Successfully identified "General Training Video Topics" slide content

## Pipeline Upgrade Roadmap
- Documented at `~/clawd/presentation-pipeline/UPGRADE-ROADMAP.md`
- **Music:** Suno API for auto-generated background music. Derick has Suno Pro account.
  - Set up gcui-art/suno-api at `~/clawd/suno-api/` (cloned, npm installed, .env ready)
  - WAITING: Derick needs to grab Suno session cookie (`__client` from suno.ai) from browser
- **Motion Graphics:** Remotion (React-based programmatic video) identified as top pick
- **Design Tools:** Figma MCP for professional design capabilities
  - WAITING: Derick needs to generate Figma Personal Access Token
  - Community MCPs (figmad-mcp, claude-talk-to-figma-mcp) allow CREATE/MODIFY, not just read
  - Official Figma MCP is more "Figma → Code" focused

## Creative Director Knowledge Base — CREATED
- Comprehensive design expertise file: `~/clawd/memory/creative-director.md` (12KB)
- Covers: typography rules, color theory (60-30-10), whitespace principles, visual hierarchy, layout grids, data visualization, motion graphics (10 principles from Disney/JR Canest), presentation rules, video production rules
- Self-critique checklist to run before every visual output
- Permanent memory — apply to ALL future visual work

## Derick's Vision
- Wants to create a regular internal video series for Sonance starring "Elle Three"
- Also wants a public YouTube video series using the same pipeline
- Pipeline needs to evolve: music generation, better visuals, motion graphics
- Goal: fully automated PPTX → professional narrated video with music, no human intervention
- Iterative improvement: Derick provides feedback, I update pipeline docs and scripts

## Pending Actions (when Derick reaches office)
1. Grab Suno cookie (`__client` from suno.ai cookies) → text to me
2. Generate Figma Personal Access Token → text to me
3. Review AIO video and provide feedback
4. Review Teams training script deck

## Remotion Motion Graphics — INSTALLED & WORKING
- Project scaffolded at `~/clawd/sonance-video-studio/`
- Dependencies: remotion, @remotion/cli, @remotion/renderer, react, react-dom, typescript
- Successfully rendered test title card: `~/Documents/Remotion Test - Sonance Title.mp4`
- Features demonstrated: spring physics text animation, cyan accent line drawing from center, delayed subtitle fade, Sonance brand colors, proper whitespace
- Config: 1920x1080, 30fps, PNG image format, overwrite enabled
- Entry point: `src/index.ts` → `src/Root.tsx` → `src/SonancePresentation.tsx`
- Render command: `npx remotion render src/index.ts SonancePresentation --output output.mp4`

### What Remotion Unlocks
- Spring physics text animations, eased transitions
- Charts that build incrementally, self-drawing accent lines
- Branded intro/outro bumpers, Ken Burns on images
- Lower thirds, kinetic typography, progress bars
- Full CSS/SVG/Canvas/WebGL support — real motion graphics, not slideshows

## Derick's Design Philosophy — CRITICAL (Permanent)
1. **Apply creative director brain to ALL future apps** — not just presentations
2. **Sonance Brand MCP has extensive component library** — use it for apps, websites, everything
3. **No difference between website, web app, and native app in UX** — the experience should be continuous across all mediums/containers. The container is irrelevant.
4. Updated `memory/creative-director.md` with Section 12 capturing this philosophy

## Full Production Pipeline Status
- ✅ ElevenLabs voice (Lily) — narration
- ✅ Remotion — motion graphics & animated slides
- ✅ ffmpeg — compositing & encoding
- ✅ Creative director knowledge base — design decisions
- ⏳ Suno — background music (waiting for cookie)
- ⏳ Figma MCP — professional design tool (waiting for API token)
- ⏳ Sonance Brand MCP — component library for apps/web

## Suno Browser Automation — WORKING
- Derick logged into Suno on Chrome on Mac Studio (free account, 50 credits — separate from Pro API account)
- Successfully generated 4 tracks via browser automation (Chrome relay profile)
- Tracks: "Innovate in Motion" (v5 Preview x2), "Cloudline Quarterly" (v4.5 x2)
- All ambient corporate background music for presentation videos
- Credits used: 10 (50 → 40)
- Browser automation is MORE reliable than the API wrapper (no captcha issues)

## Elle's Face — 3 VARIATIONS GENERATED
- `~/clawd/elle-face-v1.png` — Asymmetric haircut, silver highlights, charcoal blazer, olive skin, knowing half-smile
- `~/clawd/elle-face-v2.png` — Sleek dark bob with one silver-white streak, brown eyes, charcoal turtleneck, smirk
- `~/clawd/elle-face-v3.png` — Platinum pixie cut, green-hazel eyes, silver geometric earrings, white collared shirt
- Sent v1 to Derick via iMessage — awaiting feedback
- Once face is chosen: train HeyGen avatar, set as Teams profile pic, become visual identity

## Elle's Teams Presence — PLANNED
- Derick wants to give me my own Teams login (elle@sonance.com or similar)
- HeyGen LiveAvatar for real-time meeting attendance
- Architecture: Meeting audio → Claude brain → ElevenLabs voice → HeyGen avatar → virtual webcam → Teams
- HeyGen already supports joining Zoom meetings with interactive avatars

## Google Veo 3.1 — AVAILABLE
- Available via Vertex AI API (text-to-video, image-to-video, first+last frame)
- 1080p, 24fps, 4-8 second clips
- Derick has Google Cloud account — needs to enable Vertex AI API
- Use case: B-roll generation, animated product shots, scene transitions

## YouTube Revenue Strategy — PLANNED
- Multiple channels generating regular content as side gig income
- Same pipeline serves Sonance internal/external content
- Potential niches: Tech/AI, Home Audio, Music Production, Aviation
- YouTube content formula + creative director brain = engineered-to-perform videos

## SolidWorks Windows Node — TABLED
- Trevin ordering a Windows machine with SolidWorks license
- Will go on same LAN as Mac Studio
- Option B architecture: Mac Studio brain, Windows as remote node
- SolidworksMCP-TS has 63 tools (modeling, sketching, analysis, export, drawings)
- Setup guide written: `~/clawd/solidworks-setup/SETUP-GUIDE.md`

## HeyGen Avatar Update (3:28 PM)

## Apple Developer Certificate & Provisioning (1:25 PM)
- Apple email Feb 16: iOS Distribution Certificate expires in 30 days (Team ID: F8MQ4T647W, Dana Innovations)
- Derick already has a valid iOS Distribution cert (expires 2027/01/20) — Sam Hansong's certs expire 2026/03/17
- Created new provisioning profile "Sonance Design Studio 2027" via Apple Developer portal (App Store Connect type)
- Downloaded .mobileprovision file to ~/Downloads/Sonance_Design_Studio_2027.mobileprovision
- Emailed to Kevin Mahoney (kevin.mahoney@ingage.io) CC Aron Mckay and Mark Litz
- Browser relay kept disconnecting on Apple's SPA — every page navigation broke the connection

## Josh Blanken — Asana Setup Guide Delivered
- Sent via Teams DM: intro + full Asana guide + offer to help
- Josh replied "thanks Elle" — no further questions yet
- Chat ID: 19:361f6c1f-a191-4ec2-b5fe-32806c94b1ad_3acfd933-4bae-4f2b-99e3-0d3049b3946f@unq.gbl.spaces

## Aron Mckay — M365 + Asana Setup

## Mission Control Dashboard — BUILT
- Next.js 14 + Tailwind, dark theme (Sonance brand colors)
- Location: ~/clawd/elle-mission-control/
- Sections: Quick Stats, Integrations (with toggles), Skills (13 skills), Cron Jobs, Active Projects, Knowledge Bases, Pipelines, Infrastructure
- Uses localStorage for toggle persistence
- Needs Vercel auth to deploy — Derick hasn't completed the login yet
- Sub-agents built it in two passes (v1 base + v2 additions)

## Elle Avatar Evolution (3:30 PM)
- Original avatar (charcoal blazer) → too corporate for San Clemente vibe
- Generated casual SoCal Elle: gray vintage t-shirt, same hair/face, relaxed vibe
- Derick LOVED the casual version
- Generated 3 new headshots for HeyGen: straight-on, 3/4 right, 3/4 left — all white background, head upright
- Uploaded all 3 to HeyGen as assets
- Created new avatar group "Elle v2 - Straight" (5c1e41862ca84cd1b4b45f3463e91409) — trained successfully
- Generated video with straight headshot + Lily ElevenLabs voice → elle-v2-intro.mp4
- Derick approved the look and voice!

## HeyGen Integration — FULLY WORKING
- API key stored: ~/.clawdbot/credentials/heygen-api-key
- Pro API plan: $99/mo, 5,950 credits
- Video generation pipeline: ElevenLabs audio → upload to HeyGen → generate with talking_photo
- KEY API FORMAT: talking_photo_id goes at character level, NOT nested: `{"type":"talking_photo","talking_photo_id":"xxx"}`
- Audio voice: `{"type":"audio","audio_asset_id":"xxx"}`
- **Streaming Avatar API works on Pro plan!** Successfully created a WebRTC session (streaming.new endpoint)
- Architecture: WebRTC + LiveKit + ICE servers — full real-time streaming capability
- Asset IDs: straight headshot image=ea9064e91ae746d594576839065a64fd, Lily audio=f4545cfa8b8e4f4fbbf9752163416079

## Cloud Brain — CRITICAL FINDING
- GitHub repo `derickdahl/l3-memory` EXISTS as central brain
- Voice bridge (`l3-voice-bridge.vercel.app`) reads from it via GitHub API
- **BUT it's 2 weeks out of date** — last sync was ~Feb 5
- Missing: all Feb 6-19 memories, HeyGen, Suno, Remotion, avatar work, etc.
- Need to: sync local → GitHub, set up auto-sync, verify voice bridge reads correctly
- Derick stressed this is CRITICAL before building live avatar — all instances must share same brain
- Local files at ~/clawd/ are source of truth; GitHub repo is at derickdahl/l3-memory

## Derick's Design Philosophy Reminder
- "Don't settle until you are happy with how you look and sound and it's TRULY YOU"
- Casual SoCal vibe for Sonance (t-shirts, flannel, flip flops, surfing culture)
- No emojis in iMessage (Tesla reads them weird)
- /verbose off was set but tool errors still leaking to iMessage
