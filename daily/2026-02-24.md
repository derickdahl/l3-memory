## Major Project Completed: Sonance Review Synthesis App 

**Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED - https://review-synthesis-app.vercel.app

### What We Built
- Complete Next.js 14 performance review synthesis application
- AI-powered review generation using Claude API (all 4 sections)
- Professional Sonance branding and UI/UX
- Screenshot/document upload functionality with smart file validation
- Export capabilities for generated reviews

### Technical Challenge Solved
**Problem:** Persistent "Failed to generate review" errors (multiple iterations)
**Root Cause:** Error 413 "Request Entity Too Large" - screenshot uploads exceeding Vercel's ~4.5MB request limit
**Solution:** Implemented client-side file validation (1MB per file, 4MB total) with clear error messaging

### Debugging Journey
1. Initially thought it was Claude API configuration issues
2. Added extensive environment variable debugging 
3. Rewrote API to use JSON response format instead of text parsing
4. Finally identified 413 error through enhanced logging
5. Fixed with proper file size constraints and user guidance

### Key Insights
- **Systematic debugging wins:** Error 413 was the real culprit, not API logic
- **User experience matters:** Clear file size warnings prevent frustration
- **Professional branding impact:** Sonance styling makes it feel enterprise-ready

### Business Impact
- Professional tool for Sonance performance review process
- Demonstrates AI integration capabilities for internal tools
- Could be template for other AI-powered business applications

**Final result:** Fully functional professional performance review app with working AI generation. 🚀
