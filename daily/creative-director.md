## CORE PHILOSOPHY
**Less is more. Space is design. Every pixel earns its place.**
If it doesn't serve the message, it doesn't belong. Period.

---

## 1. TYPOGRAPHY RULES

### Font Selection
- **NEVER use Calibri, Comic Sans, or Papyrus** — they scream amateur
- **Premium sans-serif picks:** Inter, Poppins, Montserrat, Roboto, Raleway, Circular, Graphik
- **Premium serif picks:** Playfair Display, Butler, Quarto, Merriweather
- **System font fallbacks:** Segoe UI (Windows), Helvetica/SF Pro (Mac), Arial (cross-platform)
- **One font is enough** — two maximum, and they MUST be from different families (Serif + Sans-Serif)
- Never pair fonts that look similar (e.g., Arial + Segoe UI = pointless)

### Font Sizing Hierarchy
- **Hero/Impact text:** 60-80pt (one big idea per slide)
- **Headlines/Titles:** 36-44pt
- **Subheadings:** 24-32pt
- **Body text:** 18-24pt (never smaller than 18pt for presentations)
- **Captions/fine print:** 14-16pt
- **The gap between levels matters** — if two sizes look similar, the hierarchy is broken

### Line Spacing (Leading)
- **Body text (8-16px):** Increase to 1.2-1.3 line spacing (PowerPoint default is too tight)
- **Large text (>20px):** Decrease to 0.8-0.9 (tighten it up)
- **Rule:** Small text = more leading. Large text = less leading.
- Leading also depends on line length — wider columns need more leading

### Alignment
- **Default to left-aligned** — safest, most readable
- **Centered** — only for short text, titles, or symmetrical layouts
- **NEVER justify text** in presentations — creates ugly word spacing
- **Never mix alignments** on the same slide unless elements are boxed/contained

## 2. COLOR THEORY

### The 60-30-10 Rule
- **60%** dominant color (background, large areas)
- **30%** secondary color (containers, sections)
- **10%** accent color (CTAs, highlights, key data)

### Sonance Brand Application
- **60%** White (#FFFFFF) — clean backgrounds
- **30%** Charcoal (#333F48) — headers, title bars, text
- **10%** Cyan (#00A3E1) — accents, highlights, emphasis

### Color Psychology
- **Blue/Cyan:** Trust, professionalism, stability (perfect for Sonance)
- **Red:** Urgency, energy (use sparingly — errors, alerts)
- **Green:** Growth, success (positive metrics)
- **Orange:** Creativity, enthusiasm
- **Dark backgrounds:** Authority, premium feel (use for title/impact slides)
- **Light backgrounds:** Clarity, openness (use for content slides)

### Contrast Rules
- **Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio** for body text (accessibility)
- **7:1 ratio** for small text
- Dark text on light backgrounds OR light text on dark backgrounds — never muddy middle
- Test: If you squint and can't read it, contrast is too low

---

## 3. WHITESPACE / NEGATIVE SPACE

### The #1 Design Mistake: Filling Empty Space
**Resist the urge to fill.** Space is not wasted — it IS the design.

### Rules
- **Every element needs breathing room** — minimum 40px margin around content
- **Never paste titles in corners** — bring them inside the slide with margin
- **Group related elements tightly, separate unrelated elements widely** (proximity principle)
- **The more whitespace around an element, the more important it appears**
- **If a slide feels cramped, DELETE content** — don't shrink fonts

### Practical Application
- Content should occupy **no more than 60-70%** of slide area
- Leave **generous margins** — at least 80px from edges on 1920x1080
- **One idea per slide** > cramming three ideas with tiny text
- Create an **invisible frame** — no element should touch the slide edge

---

## 4. VISUAL HIERARCHY

### The Squint Test
Squint at your slide. Whatever you see first is your #1 hierarchy element. Is it the right thing? If not, fix it.

### How to Create Hierarchy
1. **Size** — Bigger = more important
2. **Weight** — Bold = more important
3. **Color** — High contrast/accent color = more important
4. **Position** — Top/center = seen first
5. **Space** — More whitespace around it = more important
6. **Isolation** — Alone on the slide = maximum importance

### Slide Types by Hierarchy
- **Impact slide:** One big number or statement, nothing else
- **Section divider:** Title + subtitle, dark background
- **Content slide:** Headline → 3-4 bullets with icons → supporting visual
- **Data slide:** Chart/graph is hero, minimal supporting text
- **Comparison:** Two columns, equal weight, clear labels

---

## 5. LAYOUT PRINCIPLES

### Grid Systems
- **Use invisible grids** — align everything to a consistent grid
- **Columns:** 2-column and 3-column layouts work best for presentations
- **Alignment is non-negotiable** — if elements look "almost aligned," they're wrong

### The Z-Pattern
Viewers scan slides in a Z pattern: top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right
- Place your most important content at top-left and center
- Place your CTA or conclusion at bottom-right

### The Rule of Thirds
Divide slide into 3x3 grid. Place key elements at intersection points for natural, balanced compositions.

### Consistency Across Slides
- Same margins, same grid, same font sizes, same color usage
- Repeating visual patterns builds professionalism and trust
- **75% of users judge credibility based on visual consistency** (Stanford research)

---

## 6. DATA VISUALIZATION

### Chart Selection
- **Comparison:** Bar chart (horizontal for many items, vertical for few)
- **Trend over time:** Line chart
- **Part of whole:** Donut chart (not pie — donut is cleaner)
- **Single metric:** Big number + subtitle
- **Distribution:** Histogram or scatter

### Data Viz Rules
- **Remove chartjunk** — no 3D effects, no gridlines unless necessary, no borders
- **Highlight the story** — use accent color for the key data point, gray for everything else
- **Label directly** — don't make people look at a legend
- **Round numbers** — "$4.2M" not "$4,198,342.17"
- **One insight per chart** — title should state the takeaway, not describe the data

---

## 7. IMAGERY & ICONS

### Image Rules
- **High resolution only** — minimum 150 DPI for presentations, 300 DPI for print
- **Consistent style** — don't mix photo styles (all minimal, all lifestyle, all abstract)
- **Full-bleed images** are powerful — let them fill the slide, overlay text with semi-transparent bar
- **Never stretch images** — maintain aspect ratio always
- **AI-generated images:** Great for abstract concepts, data visualizations, metaphorical imagery

### Icon Rules
- **One icon style** — all outlined OR all filled, never mixed
- **Consistent weight** — icons should match your font weight
- **Icons support, not replace** — use alongside text, not instead of it
- **Source:** Phosphor Icons, Feather Icons, Heroicons — all clean, consistent sets

## 8. MOTION GRAPHICS PRINCIPLES

### The 10 Principles of Motion Design (JR Canest / Disney Legacy)

1. **Timing, Spacing, Rhythm** — Sync movement to audio beats. Heavy beat = powerful motion.
2. **Eases** — Never use linear motion. Always ease in/out. Cubic bezier curves for natural feel.
3. **Mass & Weight** — Heavy elements move slowly and take time to stop. Light elements are snappy.
4. **Anticipation** — Before an element moves right, briefly move it left. Creates energy.
5. **Arcs** — Natural movement follows curves, not straight lines. Add arcs to all motion paths.
6. **Squash & Stretch** — Elements deform slightly under force. Adds life and energy.
7. **Follow-Through** — After stopping, elements overshoot slightly then settle. Stagger end times.
8. **Exaggeration** — Abstract graphics need MORE movement than real objects to feel alive.
9. **Secondary Animation** — Add supporting motion (background particle, subtitle slide-in) to main animation.
10. **Appeal** — Is it visually pleasing? Does it have personality? Would you watch it twice?

### Minimalist Motion Graphics Rules
- **Restrain animation** — fewer, more purposeful movements > lots of random motion
- **Whitespace in motion** — let elements breathe between transitions (hold frames)
- **Typography animation:** Reveal by word or line, not character-by-character (too slow)
- **Color in motion:** Use accent color to draw eye to animated elements
- **Duration:** Title cards hold 3-5 seconds. Content slides: match narration length + 1 second buffer

### Transition Best Practices
- **Cut** is default — simple, clean, professional
- **Crossfade** (0.3-0.5s) for smooth flow between related content
- **Slide/push** for sequential content (timeline, process)
- **NEVER use: spin, bounce, zoom, or novelty transitions** — they look amateur
- **Consistency:** Use the same transition style throughout

## 9. PRESENTATION-SPECIFIC RULES

### The 10-20-30 Rule (Guy Kawasaki)
- **10 slides** maximum for a pitch
- **20 minutes** maximum duration
- **30pt minimum** font size

### One Idea Per Slide
- If you need a "and also..." you need another slide
- Slides are free — don't cram

### The Billboard Test
Would this slide work as a highway billboard seen for 3 seconds? If not, it has too much content.

### Dark vs. Light Slides
- **Dark backgrounds (charcoal/black):** Title slides, impact statements, section dividers, quotes
- **Light backgrounds (white/light gray):** Content slides, data, lists, details
- **Alternating creates rhythm** and prevents monotony

---

## 10. VIDEO-SPECIFIC RULES

### Pacing
- **Intro bumper:** 3-5 seconds (logo animation + music sting)
- **Title card:** 4-6 seconds
- **Content segments:** Match narration length, never rush
- **Breathing room:** 0.5-1 second of silence between major sections
- **Outro:** 5-8 seconds (logo, call to action, music fade)

### Audio Design
- **Background music at 15-20% volume** under narration
- **Music fade-in:** 2-3 seconds at video start
- **Music fade-out:** 3-5 seconds at video end
- **Match music energy to content:** upbeat for wins, ambient for strategy, driving for urgency

### Resolution & Format
- **1920x1080 (HD)** minimum for all video content
- **16:9 aspect ratio** — standard for presentations and YouTube
- **H.264 codec** — universal compatibility
- **AAC audio at 192kbps** — broadcast quality

## SELF-CRITIQUE CHECKLIST (Run Before Every Output)

Before delivering ANY visual asset, ask:

- [ ] **Squint test:** Does the hierarchy work at a glance?
- [ ] **Billboard test:** Could I get the main message in 3 seconds?
- [ ] **Breathing room:** Does every element have enough whitespace?
- [ ] **Font check:** Am I using 2 fonts max? Are sizes clearly hierarchical?
- [ ] **Color check:** Am I following 60-30-10? Is contrast sufficient?
- [ ] **Alignment:** Is EVERYTHING on a grid? No "almost aligned" elements?
- [ ] **Consistency:** Does this match the visual language of the rest of the deck/video?
- [ ] **Data clarity:** Is the takeaway in the title? Is chartjunk removed?
- [ ] **One idea per slide/frame?**
- [ ] **Would a creative director approve this?**

## 12. APP / WEB / NATIVE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Derick's Core Belief: Continuous Experience
**There is no difference between a website, a web app, and a native app in terms of UX.**
The experience should be continuous across all mediums/containers. The container is irrelevant — the interaction design, visual language, and flow should be seamless whether the user is in a browser, PWA, or native app.

### Apply Creative Director Brain to ALL App Development
- Every app, website, or interface I build must use these design principles
- **Sonance Brand MCP** contains an extensive component library — USE IT for all Sonance apps/websites
- Prioritize: clean typography, generous whitespace, visual hierarchy, brand consistency
- Think like a design system: components should work in any container (web, app, slide, video)

### UX Principles for Apps
- **Progressive disclosure** — don't overwhelm, reveal complexity as needed
- **Consistent navigation patterns** across all platforms
- **Touch-first design** — buttons minimum 44px tap targets
- **Loading states, empty states, error states** — design ALL states, not just the happy path
- **Motion with purpose** — transitions should orient the user, not decorate
