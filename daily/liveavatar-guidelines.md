# LiveAvatar Custom Avatar Guidelines

## Video Structure (MUST be continuous, no cuts)
1. **15 sec listening** — Smile and nod to camera, "listen" as if someone is speaking
2. **90 sec speaking** — Talk naturally, conversation style, smile, be natural
3. **15 sec idling** — Look at camera, breathe and smile, no obvious movement

## DO
- Well-lit, quiet environment
- Pause between sentences with mouth closed
- Keep body position stable, minimal movement

## DON'T
- Stitches or cuts in footage
- Talking without pauses
- Changing positions while recording
- Loud background noise
- Shadows or overexposure on face
- Diverting gaze or looking around
- Hand gestures above the chest
- Obvious gestures or body movements

## Key Problem
- Veo generates 8-sec max clips — can't do continuous 2-min take
- LiveAvatar requires ONE continuous recording, no stitching
- Need HeyGen support to enable non-human character upload (skips webcam consent)
- Or find a way to generate a single continuous 2-min video

## Status
- Contacted HeyGen support for non-human character process
- 2-min stitched video ready at ~/clawd/elle-training-video.mp4 (but stitched = bad)
